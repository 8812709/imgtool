This project is all about an image processing tool based on fastapi which can help in resizing & converting the image to a particular aspect ratio,compressing its size etc. so that it can be uploaded to exam portals which allows definite size and aspect ratio of images.


TO ESTABLISH THE BACKEND SERVER.

OPEN THE TERMINAL AND CHANGE THE DIRECTORY TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY WHERE MAIN.PY FILE IS PRESENT.

BEFORE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE NEXT STEP MAKE SURE UVICORN AND FASTAPI IS INSTALLED.

RUN THE COMMAND IN THE TERMINAL-
uvicron main:app --reload

OPEN FASTAPI SWAGGER UI OR THE CUSTOM FRONTEND TO SEND REQUEST TO THE SERVER WITH PARAMETERS LIKE HEIGHT, WIDTH & SIZE AND GET THE RESIZED IMAGE ON THE BASIS OF THAT WITH OT WITHOUT MAINTAINING THE ASPECT RATIO OF IT AND THE DESIRED SIZE OF IMAGE.
